# Stalker like anomalies for Arma 3
This is a small side project of mine to create some anomalies like they are found in the STALKER game series. By no means are these feature complete and there are still tons of bugs. I started working on this as I noticed a lack of available addons or mods that offer anomalies, like they are found in the zone.

If you like this idea and want to contribute, just do a pull request.
If you want to use this in a mission, sure go ahead, but please write me in the credits.

This project is aiming to be compatible with addons CBA and ACE. ACE itself is a soft requirement and is only needed for the burner anomaly right now. It should work in single and multiplayer. It tries to use as much content as vanilla offers, so this project can be implemented on mission basis and does not need any addons (besides CBA and ACE).

Additionally a mod verison has been added which adds some items and uses CBA settings, so mission makers do not need to add the sounds and scripts to their missions. Just make sure to enable the anomalies in the CBA settings first!

Link to mod version on workshop: TBA
